Explanation for additional elements
Firewall
controls incoming and outgoing traffic filtering them as per some specific rules
SSL Certificates
Encrypts the information sent by the client and server to give access to owners of primary keys
Monitoring clients
to gather and report metrics of server perfomance.
1 extra server
for redundancy in order to make our services highly available

What are firewalls for?
controls incoming and outgoing traffic filtering them as per some specific rules

Why is the traffic served over HTTPS?
It Encrypts the information sent by the client and server to give access to owners of primary keys

What monitoring is used for?
gather and report metrics of server perfomance.

How the monitoring tool is collecting data
a client is installed on the server that collects the perfomance metrics and reports them.

Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
you can use a monitoring tool that collects the data and sends to you

ISSUES WITH THE SYSTEM
Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
SSL certificate generation requires some cryptography calculations that are resource intensive that will impact the perfomance of the loadbalancer
Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
Response time is affected as only one server is handling all requests of querrying.
Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
Each component need a specific environment to run so bundling everything in one server will make optimization difficult
