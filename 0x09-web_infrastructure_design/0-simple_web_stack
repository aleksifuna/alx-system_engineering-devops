ISSUES WITH THE SERVER
SPOF
since we are using one server to respond to our clients request whenever it goes down the whole application goes offline as there is no redundancy to improve on availability.
Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
Incase we need to do maintenance on the app the whole system will go offline since we havent provided a redundancy plan.
Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
our system is pretty much fixed as we are running only one server. incase of too much traffic response time will be greatly affected.
